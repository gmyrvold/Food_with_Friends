Welcome to Food with Friends!
This is both a private and public server, and you as the user are free to use it however you'd like!

Your personal pantry will allow you to create and store your own recipes, whether they be your own, from a loved one, or even online... they are all here online in one place for your easy access! 

If you'd like to explore and try something new, visit the public pantry where other users can share recipes of their own for other to view, try out, and interact with. Each shared recipe allows users to comment on the recipe to provide feeback and tips, and maybe even make new friends!

I created this project from the love I have for cooking, but also out of my own desperation for a way to store all of my recipes all in one place. Nowadays, most online recipes include dozens and dozens of pop-up ads, along with long paragraphs about the individual who posted the recipe, which typically involvs a lot of scrolling and navigating the page just to find the ingredients and instructions. This server will hold any recipe and it cuts out anything that can be inconvinient when you're trying to cook, especially when it's something you've never made before. I wanted to keep this server as clean and neat as possible, so people can access anything they want to make without the hassle.
